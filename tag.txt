finally something worth noting, I set up a successful Docker cluster of containers, and they run smoothly:
1. A single service (drivers) and its worker processes (rabbitMQ consumers).
2. SQL database container.
3. RabbitMQ container.

I set up a Docker Compose YAML file for them and kept at it until they worked.
I am really proud and happy about this moment. When things aren't going well, I'll always look back at this moment.
