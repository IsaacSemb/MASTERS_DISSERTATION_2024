I am building a system for fleet management
currently for my dissertation but wwill later transition into a perasonal project for advancement

this is to show the viability of using a micro service architecture as opposed to a monolith

Due to this being a learning project, i hand picked a few services to include
1. driver service (to store driver details and driver related logic like availability
2. vehicle service ( to store vehicle data and do vehicle related logic like availability  )
3. assignment service ( responsible for the logic of assigning drivers to vehicles and logic of sorting out their availability )
4. maitenance service ( logic for routine maintenance, repairs and predictive maintenance )
5. scheduling service ( a schedule builder for all timeline operations  )
6. fuel consumption service ( fuel management and logging )
7. tasks service ( responsible for all granular tasks carried out everyday by the fleet )
